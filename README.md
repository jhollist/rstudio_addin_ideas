# List of Rstudio Add-in ideas

I really want to spend some time playing around with RStudio Add-ins.  This is
just a running list of ideas

1. hubit - an RStudio add-in to turn an RStudio project into a github 
repository.  My use case for this is that I usually create an empty github 
repo first, then create a project from version control with rstudio.  Often, 
though, I forget and create a project first, but then I want to get it up as a 
repo.  This requires more effort as I have to then create a repo, add the remote
URL, push ...  An add-in could handle all of this with the click of button 
(or key)!
