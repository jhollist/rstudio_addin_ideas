This is\njust a running list of ideas\n\n1. hubit - an RStudio add-in to turn an RStudio project into a github \nrepository.  My use case for this is that I usually create an empty github \nrepo first, then create a project from version control with rstudio.  Often, \nthough, I forget and create a project first, but then I want to get it up as a \nrepo.  This requires more effort as I have to then create a repo, add the remote\nURL, push ...  An add-in could handle all of this with the click of button \n(or key)!",
